IMPROVED DETECTION AND PREVENTION MECHANISMS FOR DDOS ATTACK IN CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT

**Objective**:
The massive diverse network which is connected over the cloud produces various traffic patterns. These patterns are analyzed and identify the DDoS attacks based on their anomaly of its nature!

**KDD Dataset** which resembles the real time networks, is being used to test the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) we have built and help us check itâ€™s performance by putting similar other existing techniques in comparison.
