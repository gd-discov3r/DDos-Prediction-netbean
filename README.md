IMPROVED DETECTION AND PREVENTION MECHANISMS FOR DDOS ATTACK IN CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT

**Objective**:
The massive diverse network which is connected over the cloud produces various traffic patterns. These patterns are analyzed and identify the DDoS attacks based on their anomaly of its nature!

**KDD Dataset** which resembles the real time networks, is being used to test the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) we have built and help us check itâ€™s performance by putting similar other existing techniques in comparison.

**Numeric to Nominal Conversion:**

The numeric data provided by the data set are converted into the nominal values using the numeric to nominal conversion operator and the relevant nd irrelevant data are differentiated.

**Feature Selection:**

we filter the nominal converted values based on its relevance and the data that are not in correlation are being filtered out. Based on this, information gain, intrinsic information and gain ratios are generated so that a better classification for the decision tree can be carried out.

**Machine Learning and Evalution:**

After the selection process, the normal and anomaly traffics are detected by the c4.5 algorithm along with others that are also implemented and the accuracy of each algorithm are compared to show the effectiveness of the main algorithm.
